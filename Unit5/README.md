# Unit 5: Connect to the internet
2 Pathways | Duration: 9 hours

Use Kotlin coroutines to perform multiple tasks at once, and learn about HTTP and REST to get data from the internet using Retrofit. Then use the Coil library to display images in your app.

* Describe the basics of concurrency and how to use coroutines in an Android app.
* Define and understand the data layer in Modern Android app architecture.
* Implement a repository to centralize data access.
* Use Retrofit to retrieve data from a remote server.
* Load and display images using the Coil library.
* Implement dependency injection to decouple the classes, making it easier to test, maintain, and scale the app.
